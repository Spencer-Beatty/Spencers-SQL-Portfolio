# SQL Portfolio by Spencer Beatty

This repository serves as a comprehensive display of my expertise in SQL and database interactions. It is segmented into two main sections:

## 1. SQL Problem Sets
Contained within the `SQL problem sets` folder, this section houses a variety of SQL problems I've tackled, ranging from basic operations to complex querying techniques. Each problem is accompanied by my solution, reflecting my methodical approach and understanding of SQL intricacies.

- **Location**: [SQL problem sets](./SQL%20problem%20sets)

## 2. GOBABBYAPP.java
An application designed to interface with a SQL database, `GOBABBYAPP.java` is a testament to my skills in integrating Java with relational databases. Through the use of JDBC, the application establishes a connection with a DB2 database, manages multiple prepared statements, and conducts a suite of preloaded SQL queries for data retrieval, insertion, and modification.

- **Location**: [GOBABBYAPP.java](./GOBABBYAPP.java)
- **Key Features**:
  - JDBC Integration
  - Driver Registration & Connection Management
  - Execution of Complex SQL Queries

**Technologies Used**: SQL, Java, JDBC, DB2
